	<h1>Kunkunshi Editor</h1>

	<h2>What is Kunkunshi Editor?</h2>
    	<p>Kunkunshi Editor is the ultimate editor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_music" target="_blank"><i>Okinawan 
    	music</i></a>. Unlike most of the music in the world, Okinawan music is not written in the traditional European music scores. Instead, 
    	they use a system called <i>kunkunshi</i> (工工四), which is a variation of the ancient Chinese system. The music in the <i>kunkunshi</i> 
    	is played with an instrument called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshin" target="_blank"><i>sanshin</i></a>, which is a 
    	variation of the traditional Chinese instrument called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanxian" target="_blank"><i>sanxian</i></a>. 
    	At the same time, the <i>sanshin</i> is the ancestor of the Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen" target="_blank">
    	<i>shamisen</i></a>.</p>
    
    	<h2>What is the structure of a <i>kunkunshi</i>?</h2>
    	<p>A <i>kunkunshi</i> contains the notes for the <i>sanshin</i> in a table. This table usually has 12 columns per page and 12 cells per 
    	column, except for the last page that just shows until the end of the music score. The table must be interpreted from top to bottom and 
    	from right to left, following the traditional Japanese reading system. Each pitch is represented by a different Chinese character, and 
    	it is possible to write a character between two cells to represent a note with smaller duration. It is important to notice that the 
    	Japanese characters do not represent fixed pitches as the western notes do, but they depend on the tuning of the <i>sanshin</i>, which 
    	in Okinawan jargon is called <i>chindami</i>. In addition to the notes, some special symbols are used to represent accidentals, 
    	repetitions and techniques such as hammer on, etc. Besides this table, the sheet may also include the notes for the voice and the 
    	lyrics of the song.</p>
